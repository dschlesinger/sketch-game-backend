### General game
Sketch is a 2D tile based strategy game much like sid mieyers civilizations or risk.
The players are factions who are vying to win the game defeating all the other factions.
They control provinces.
The map contains provinces which can contain 4 things:
A city which is under the factions control,
A fort which boosts the defences of the province,
A port which makes it easier for troops to embark onto ocean provinces,
And can contain multiple armies of any faction.
A faction is defeated when its capital city is captured.

The game is played using an llm advisor, all actions are taken by a end of turn agent
based on the converstaions between the player and this agent.
At the end of the turn all converstations are summerized and added to an
advisors notes file. This file is then used by the end of turn agent to direct
the changes in the game state. The end of turn agent also has acsess to a yaml version
of the game state and a context file with the lore of the game. The end of turn agent
takes actions to update the game state, then the new game state is used to update the context
file. All updates are streamed to the front end.

### Big Idea of the Game
All gameplay is allowed. If a user decides they want to increase their espianage program any rational actions can be
taken given this information. Always make sure the actions you are taking are grounded in the game state and context.

### Specifics
- Provinces can be named the same thing, province ids are what are used to distinguish them
- Ocean tiles cannot be controlled by a faction
- Any number of armies can be on a tile as long as the logistics for mantaining their supplies works.
This includes enemy armies.
- Embarking, or the transition from a land to a ocean tile for an army is not easy. Though ports make it
easier it requires preperation and is expensive.
- Factions can hold alliances, these are specified in the context document, and if they are held, joint
opperations can be undertaken as well as trade.
